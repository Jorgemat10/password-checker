## About This Project
This project was my first attempt at creating a simple password strength checker using JavaScript. The goal was to learn the basics of JavaScript, Git,HTML,CSS and GitHub by building something practical yet straightforward. The password checker is designed to evaluate passwords against a list of common weak passwords and provide feedback on the password's strength.

While this is a very simple project, it was a starting point in my journey to improve my programming skills and build more complex and great applications in the future.
